## Write up
As CK said, this assignment was basically wiring together my PA1, PA2 and PA3, changing what was necessary to make the three work nicely together. I broke up changes related to each assignment specifically below, but here are some things I changed overall.

### Overall Changes
First, I created a new VS2017 Cloud Service project, then started by adding all of my PA3 code by manually (to make sure everything built). I then added my PA2's GetQuerySuggestions.asmx to the Web Role, then added my Trie.cs and TrieNode.cs to my class library for easy access.
I did not re-use my PA2's frontend, instead electing to write a new front-end. My PA2's frontend wasn't worth trying to fix up.

### PA1 Changes
For PA1, I initially had implemented the spelling correction extra credit to find close matches
### PA2 Changes

### PA3 Changes

## Extra credit write up
1. No extra credit this time around, got a lot of non-school stuff going on in my life right now. I just tried to get the basics working well.
